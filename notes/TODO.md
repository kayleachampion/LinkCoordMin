# TODOS
* Test location spoofing
* proxies?
* example of parsing mhtml data
* make a simple sqlite database or something for managing query categories?
* might be good to get all date strings into the same format. Will make it easier to put into relational db 

* Create a Python env file

* nicer CLI interface
* make it nicer to select a subset of all query categories
