# Collecting Google Trends data
trends.js is using the google-trends-api node package to collect data from Google trends


To generating queries, you will need to install `suggests` from here: https://github.com/gitronald/suggests


First run `query_selection_code/trends.js` and `query_selection_code/recurse_suggests.py`

Then run `query_selection_code/script_generated_queries.py`

Now you should be ready to collect SERPs!
